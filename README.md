# Movie Guessing Game
The Movidle is a movie guessing game. Players have five chances to guess a movie name, with 
feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles that reveal specific information about 
the movie, such as year, genre, origin, director, and star. After every guess, each tile is marked 
as either green or red: green indicates that the information is correct, while red indicates it is 
wrong.
